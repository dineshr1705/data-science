In scikit-learn (sklearn), there are several preprocessing techniques available for encoding categorical features, each serving a different purpose. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, scikit-learn offers the following categorical encoding techniques:

		Label Encoding:

			sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder
			Converts each category into a numerical value, starting from 0.
			Suitable for ordinal categorical variables (where there's an inherent order).

		One-Hot Encoding:

			sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder
			Converts categorical features into binary vectors (0s and 1s) for each category.
			Suitable for nominal categorical variables (where categories have no intrinsic order).

		Ordinal Encoding:

			Custom approach, not directly provided by scikit-learn.
			Converts ordinal categorical features into ordered numeric values, preserving the ordinal relationship.
			Requires manual specification of category ordering.

		Target Encoding (Mean Encoding):

			Not directly provided by scikit-learn.
			Replaces categorical values with the mean of the target variable for that category.
			Useful for encoding categorical variables when the target variable is numeric.

		Frequency (Count) Encoding:

			Custom approach, not directly provided by scikit-learn.
			Replaces categorical values with their frequency (count) in the dataset.
			Can be useful when the frequency of occurrence carries information.

		Binary Encoding:

			Not directly provided by scikit-learn.
			Converts category integers to binary code, then splits the digits into separate columns.
			Useful when you have a large number of categories and want to reduce the dimensionality of the encoded feature space.
