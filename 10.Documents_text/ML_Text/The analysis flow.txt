1. Approach The analysis will follow the below approach

 Part 1: Data Prepration
     --> Understand the Data Structure
     --> Deep Analysis on each column (feature or variable). 
         What values withhold? Number of count? Missing value? Error?
 Part 2: Data Cleaning
     --> Clean the data
         Correct the content, fill the missing data, modify the content etc
     --> Introduce new columns to help understand the data better
 Part 3: Data Analysis
     --> Analyse the retionships between column(s) and the Survival Rate, 
         to find out what type of group people were likely to survive
 Part 4: Feature Importance
     --> Analysis on feature importance to show which features have more significant impact to the   
         survival rate 
 Part 5: Model Selection
     --> This is a typical supervised classification problem. I chose quite a number of models to compare    
         the accuracy. One thing I noticed that if I use the original train and test dataset for model training 
         and fitting, I could get 100% accuracy rate on SVC model. The reason is that SVC is using Sex as 
         one of most significant features. In the test data set, all the females survived and all the males 
         didn't survive. Therefore I get biases on my model. Therefore, I split the training dataset for the 
         model training and accuracy scores. The results look more realistic now.
